# MySQL-practise
My hands-on SQL practice project focused on strengthening core concepts, from basic table setups and simple queries to core functions and clauses. Part of my ongoing journey toward mastering advanced SQL and data analysis. A work-in-progress repository that I'll keep on updating as I practise more.
